## DS3-SisCat

This is a public repository of scripts used in research projects of the research group Digitalization for the Sustainability of the Healthcare System (DS3) The research activity of the DS3 group focuses on digital health, including the areas of digital epidemiology and digital solutions aimed at improving the quality of care, the sustainability of the healthcare system, and the integration of care pathways.

The DS3 research group has a multidisciplinary team with specialties in a broad repertoire of scientific areas, such as computer science, mathematics, epidemiology, clinical research, public health, and implementation science.

The free and universal healthcare provided by the Catalan Health System to a catchment population of 7.5 million people is a privileged substrate for building evidence on the use of digital solutions for healthcare. We believe that, if used appropriately, these solutions can increase equity in healthcare provision
